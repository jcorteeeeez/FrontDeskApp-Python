I used Python Tkinter for the FrontDeskApp.

I used SQLite for the database. 

I used VSCode for my IDE.

I install different extensions so that the program will work smoothly.

To view the database in VSCode, install SQLite. 


For demonstration, Small Boxes has a limit of 6. Medium Boxes have a limit of  4. Lastly, Large Boxes have a limit of 2.

On the Retrieve Box, a box will appear when a customer store a box. It has a timestamp. When you click on it, it will retrieve the customer box.


When you click Store Box, you will prompt to choose what box is being stored.

When the box reaches its limit, a pop-up window will appear and it cant add the box to the area.


Sorry for 1 hour late submission! :)
